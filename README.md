**Progress Report For February 1, 2017**  

**What we did:**
Finalized the use of driveStraight and TurnToHeading, also worked on driveStraightDistance. (Tried to) configure Dell DS for use and did some troubleshooting on member's laptops

**What was learned:**
This was the complete opposite of yesterday. We only had about 6 programmers show up today and most of them were able to work on the robot with mentors. I think the ideal mentor to programmer ratio is around 3. That way, people can 

**What we have coming up:**
Actually, I'm cancelling Friday's meeting. We don't have much to do and I think your time is better spent preparing for school or whatever you want. However, we will have a meeting on Saturday where we will have a robot with the gear delivery system and the climber.

**MVP of the Day:**
I'd say Isabel and Adam. Isabel because she kept on asking me if there was work to do instead of getting distracted and Adam because he kept asking questions and was involved in the work done.
