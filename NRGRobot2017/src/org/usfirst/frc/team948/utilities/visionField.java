	 * to +1 (all the way to the right)

	 * Omega is the distance from the camera to the point on the plane of the robot that is used for the calculation of v.

	 * Gamma is the change in heading (in radians) that is needed to face the center of the object.
	 * 
	 * All distances are measured in inches.
